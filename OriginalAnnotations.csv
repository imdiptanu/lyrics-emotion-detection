And adorned with Stars
With her deft allusion and a Universe between Us
She showed me her skill with words and I showed her my Scars
Don't mistake kindness for affection, she said
Don't ever let the attention go to your Head
No more let Death divide what Life can join Together
But just remember there is nothing that can last Forever
And Jade is Benediction
She is silent Prayer
And Jade is Exaltation
The colours that I wear
And Jade is Contradiction
She is naked but never bare
Jade is a Work, a work of Fiction
Nothing more than Castles in the Air
The shorter the leash the harder I will pull
My glass is Empty when once it was Full
I wish I could be Jesus and turn water into Wine
'Cause all my grapes have withered, withered on the vine
With a smile like Mercury, elusive and fey
There's a Beauty in the night that can't be seen by day
She's a barbed wire Angel insatiable and cruel
She destroys my resistance like the most Dazzling Jewel
And Jade is Apostasy
Abandoned Faith and Hope
Jade is Hypocrisy
She is Kaleidoscope
And Jade is Precious Stone
Impervious and Rare
And Jade will never atone
For the Flowers in her Hair
And Jade never sleeps alone
There's always someone there
With Jade
To rest their Head on her thigh
To make her moist when she is dry
To hold the Breath of every sigh
To pledge their Life and how to Die
To kiss the sleep from her Eyes
To dry the Tears when she Cries
And Jade is all and Jade is None
And Jade is Moon and she is Sun
And Jade is You and Everyone

That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your buddy

Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)

I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""

Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:

Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked

Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State, that's…

New York (yeah), New York (uh)

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah)

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say, ""Yeah"" (come on)

26,Garth Brooks,Country,That Summer,The Chase,1993.0,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And, I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back

The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""

With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh

Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home
Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company

All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!

Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard

Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke

Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in

That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip

Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a Sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)

Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with their backs out

Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs

You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryna get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime

Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowing without any knowing
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay

62,The Cure,Rock,Disintegration,Disintegration,1989.0,"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming it over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams

And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter

This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these

So loud like a cloud with thunder and LIGHTNING
So proud to the crowd it is somewhat FRIGHTENING
No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed
There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin cannot cease; BREAK!

Courageous and contagious so you better break North

His name is Jay he's here to play, and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me

From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
The word is heard as told by D
I don't sing I bring, much delight
Like a star shinin bright in the darkest night
If you are cold, I'll bring you heat
Like I brought the whole world my funky beat
Mysterious and serious I ain't no joke
Fire from the depths of hell AND YOU CAN SMELL THE SMOKE!

Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed

With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch

Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it

It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date."" — ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0

But you know what?

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me

Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks

It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?

Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high

I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber

And walked the night alone

Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all, oh

I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold
The seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light

The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light

To bring the balance back
Bring it back

With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!

Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!

The coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time
To prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy
But folks just called him yellow
Something always told me
They were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old
When his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy
Cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words
My brother said to Tommy
Son my life is over, but yours has just begun

Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

There's someone for everyone
And Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have
To prove he was a man
One day while he was working
The Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky
N'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door
And saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look
Was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace
Took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face
He heard these words again

Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up
And met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said
""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling
Was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back
He let 'em have it all
Tommy left the bar room
Not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky""
As he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

I promised you, Dad
Not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak
I didn't turn the other cheek
Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight

N.W.A is back in this motherfucker
And this is only the single
Wait until the motherfucking album comes out
We gone have some more of that good shit
The shit you just can’t fuck with
But yo, we ain’t finished, tell ‘em what’s up man
Yo man, there’s a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick, man
In every motherfuckin' state
Wanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like
Wanna dress like, wanna sound like muthafuckin' style stealin'
Clone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man
Non-reality seein', non-reality feelin'
Non-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man
Hey, I don’t know, reality, it’s important to me, man
So fellas man, tell these niggas what it’s like in the minds of real niggas

Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
And you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don’t try to hang, you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass you’ll get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10

First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think a rap will last?
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy

Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Try us and take it
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in

It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas

You can run, but you can’t hide, you know I'mma find'cha
Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha
Don’t look back because you’re shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on
Don’t say it’s psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow

All these niggas wit the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it’s the shit that we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead

Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get?
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real

Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats

They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes, I’ll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Cause if I let you slide, it’s just cause you lucked up
Don’t come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas

Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad there's
Sucka muthafuckas like you, making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that’s smart
A nigga that’s paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say
But I'm a do the shit anyway
Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink

Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict

Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone

Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried

Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts

I'm almost stone cold dead

Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear

The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round

And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway

I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside

She saw both their lives flash before her eyes

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock

She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way

And on those lonely nights
I could think of them once more
Keep your words alive inside my head
If I had only known
I'd never hear your voice again

You were the one who always stood beside me
So unaware I foolishly believed
That you would always be there
But then there came a day
And I turned my head and you slipped away

Bigger shank to fill your tank

Slide, do or die, fry to bake

Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit

Check out my gravel pit

Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb

And make-believe we never needed

Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

What's wrong with your hair right now?
Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too
Look, I'mma tell you like this

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to 'em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
'Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin'?""
See, I'm only down for screwin', but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
'Cause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give
And no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
'Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messing with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube, girl, 'cause I ain't the one

Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. 'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face
I know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's getting juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
'Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out
'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster, huh? I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

I don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none
Yeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?

Give you money? Why bother?
'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself, homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em
I used to get no play; now she stay behind me
'Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some; now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used?
But I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it?
'Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

But you said you love me!
I don't see no rings on this finger
Why you doin' me like this? I love you!

And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""

What? Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This like, this '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight, incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan
Into the fire, transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back
In the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot
And blow spots, you want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your thought is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell, globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings

March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat basslines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo yo yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, sazon season these degrees
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor, word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, Lex, the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening

The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics
It's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door

Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws

Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers

Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China

So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets

I wanna see some panties droppin'

(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I’m head huntin'
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog

Til when? (Til the early morn')
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough

So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick

So why don't you all just grab your bags

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One

Answering any other service
Perogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my ability
After the battle they admit that I'm with it
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with
Like wind, vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called plug tunin'

(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma
Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know'
Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet
Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid

Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick
Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative
Flow to the sway cause I say fa-so-la-ti
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell
Motions of the Soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant sends L.I. on the strong map
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap
Style of the Tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all
Watch while the pitcher is pitching
Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard Dove crying, I ain't fearing
Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the B-B cause if you try to grieve me

220,De La Soul,Hip-Hop,Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa,De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,"""If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions""

This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad

Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot""
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self

Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?""
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess

Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it

You can do what you want, just keep it out of my neighborhood
Personally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh
I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit
Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word?
All over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise
The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit
What you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?
Motherfucker I got kids, I don't want 'em listenin' to that bullshit
{*hospital monitor starts beeping*}
Fuck the niggas!
Motherfuckers need to stop
How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?
{*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*}
 Flatline
 Bullshit!

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out
Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
I guess it's just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder
Fuck flippin' burgers, cause I deserve a
Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of

But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin' paid like a motherfucker
A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another
Yeah

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get face down in the street
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty
Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat
Gettin' paid to say this shit here
Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So why not call myself a nigga?
It's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river
And then I get called a nigga anyway
Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so

Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love that you niggas (""niggas for life"")

The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract
The attention of another, I mean the other
But I'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'
Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!

I call myself a nigga cause my skin won't lighten
I call myself a nigga cause the shit that I'm writin
Hypes me, hypes other motherfuckers around me
And that's the reason why they wanna surround me
And ask me - why do I call myself a negro?
Ain't none of their fuckin' business cause I'll let the trigger go

I wonder who they fucked up today?
*Screeching Tires*
You motherfucker!
*Machine Gun Fire*
(Got him)

Pull over to the side right now
Man, fuck them motherfuckers!

Yo, Dre! Give me a funky-ass bassline!
Right here!

Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the mothafucka that you read about
Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!
This is a gang and I'm in it
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
With a right left, right left, you toothless
And then you say: ""Goddamn, they ruthless!""
Everywhere we go they say: ""Damn!""
N.W.A's fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don’t just say no, we’re too busy sayin', ""Yeah!""
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me I’ll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta!
Hopin' you sophisticated motherfuckers
Hear what I have to say

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggas start breakin' out
'Cause you know, they know what’s up
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin'
""I got a boyfriend""—bitch, stop lyin'!
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said, ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said: ""Let's start some shit""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom, boom, boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin'
And cussin', I stepped back and I kept bustin'
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll tell you exactly how he feel
And don't hold a fuckin' thing back

Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car—are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!
Man, what'cha gon' do now?
(What we're gonna do right here is go way back)
How far you goin' back? (Way back)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this""—hit it!

Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold runnin' shit

Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We want to fuck you, Eazy,"" I want to fuck you too
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with

So peep it out here goes the info
This is a bitch that did the whole crew
She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through
And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And she'll let you videotape her
And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch would let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut
And they even take the broomstick up the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take,"" she asks
""To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shakes?""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable
I couldn't pay the bitch to quit
Cuz the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit
That made me start havin' a fit'
Cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick 


Now one night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggas straight drove in
I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no
Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'
Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with
Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit
And I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket
To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it
So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar
And got the fuck out the car
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next
I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta
Peep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!
And she's only 14 and a ho'
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized
I told the bitch to do it quick
You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!


Now I'm a break it down with a fact
Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they couldn't quit
Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit
And those are the main ones that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it
So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye
And then the ho' will fall to the ground
Then you'll open up her mouth
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano
Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night
Because she just can't quit

Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers

Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition

Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

So wipe your Lottos on the mat

Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

Eye know Eye love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

Eye know Eye love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me cause

Eye know Eye love you better

It's I again and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two

Ravaged
By the hands that feed

And out to sea

Learn from treacherous bibles
Of murder, hate and war

In an ocean of rain

Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby what about you, come on

(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...

And started whoopin' her ass worse than before

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind

That first step you take is the longest stride

So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom
Confusing me with questions like...

Do you ever get nervous?

I be 4'11""

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
Product of a North Carolina cat
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
Look ma, no protection
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
(And that'll be sometime soon)
Faker than a fist of kids
Speakin that they're black
When they're just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied
And said ""We'll be natives to the end""
Nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool
Now I won't apologize for it
This is not a bunch of Bradys
But a bunch of black man's pride
Yet I can safely say
I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside
I've always walked the right side of the road
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs
But a man with a plan
And if I was a rug cleaner
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am

The Plug Two brand with the flavour
In the flute watch the sniffin'
So a sack of shows in demand
I read the diction from the second page
I got the one-two gauge
Baritone to the izm fan
Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink
So let me need ya to my ems go
I push the infinite and carry it
My carrier's the three over one
So my pluggins already know
Lick shots with moo
Catch the boo
From a ghost in the heckling crowd
If I give a foot
Jack Ville caught a spill
When a still came from my mouth
I brought a head down south
I don't check for the noose and the neck
So I never tell my ems
That finesse is knocking at my door
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun
And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore
I bring the element H with the 2
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade
It's just mind over matter
And what matters is
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade
I keep the walking on the right side
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong
Cuz that's how he wants to be
No difference, see
I wanna be like the name of this song I am

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
The deeds of a natural
Are seeds that are no longer planted
So the famine in the mind is strong
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane
Sane enough to let you know from within this song
I stabilize many cableized viewers
So my occupation's known
But not why I occupy
And that is to bring the peace

So I pulled up

Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep

He didn't pour me a beer

He said: ""You can't find that here

Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""

Taken about a year after we were wed""

He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

They build my confidence

From the wishbook order me
A pair of red shoes for my feet"", so mama did

Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer

It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?

Waving powerless and blind
But tomorrow, we'll be kind
Let love guide us through the rain
Forget our yesterday

Brings us together
Only love, love, love

Only love can conquer all and move mountains
When you cold, only love makes you warm again
Only love heals a broken heart, we been through
It all girl, came through the storm again
Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me
Forever in my eyes, you will always be the one for me
I'll always love you until they read out my eulogy

Ride or die that's what love is for
Believe it or not, God loves us all

You were down with me
Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back

Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me

Even though it's just a low paying gig
Some of us will boast and brag
And those of us who think we're small
Just because we don't have much
That's really not the case at all
There's riches that the flesh can't touch
Some of us won't respect names
Some of us won't respect loves
Some of us don't respect life
Even though we worship God
And some of us won't let go faith
No matter what the price may cost
Some of us won't practice hate
Because we still believe in love

What you won't and what you will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Neighbors free to shoot at will
Hurt' to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five, we know the drill
Weekends are such a short-lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

Most of us think we're too good
Just because material gain
If we were living as we should
Then less of us would be in pain
Those who are misunderstood
Still deserve a voice to claim
The things that are still meaningful
To each and all of us the same
And some will say the cups are full
And give Jah thanks to what we've gained
And some will say there's much more weight to pull
And them will tell you that straight up and plain
And some will think outside the box
While some of us will hold our lanes
And some of us we write the facts
While some of us a chop down cane

What men won't and what they will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Hurts to see the old slave mill

Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Me a tell you, dem nuh know)
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Fi be real, them nuh have a clue!)

Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things, to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of amibition, they do

Why every Indian wanna be the chief?
Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gon' idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming, gunning I stand position
L's known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uhh
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judus, backstabbers do this

Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do

It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

What you won’t do, do for love

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans

A win win, come again)

Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?

(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love but you are not gonna stop loving that person)

What—in the fat fishes of a phenomenal
Fahrvergnügen fuck—is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song
I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
And witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells
See these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales
And I shit on these males, till it's stinkin'
Fouler, than a weed smell,nigga, your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?
Talking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail
Until they cripple, see I cook, like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!) Oh, see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)
It’s kinda like, me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (What!?)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up, like boots
When I’m pushing they face in the mud—
(Ahgah!) Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
And gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!)
Shit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)
Your head up off your shoulders (With)
Bullets bigger, than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)
And the way it’s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)
See, me and Shady together; we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch
(We that sick!) like I come from Haiti
I’m suggesting you pay me, don’t make me wanna spaz
(Al-la-la!) Like I’m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)
While I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Now it’s mine, and I’m putting my feet up (Black!)
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long
Niggas is asking if the hook had died, nah
But the beat is fried!

Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying ""He's bi!""
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, ""Rape!""—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
""Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!"", 'cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
""Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?""
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
""I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!""
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God; I'm the S.O.G
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog
Yes, yes, y’all (Wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So (""Jump around! Jump! Jump!"")
Get that ass shaking (""Jump around! Jump!"")
Came to hit you, with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and (""Jump!"")
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success, than I am of failure

Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)
Tell 'em where you from!

Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum, and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…

Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E

You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother

""But I'm only going to get this one chance.""
""Something's wrong, I can feel it.""
Six minutes. Six minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not

Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?

Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world had you licked
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Needing help on the sand put you under quick
Big mama said ""the Devil's up to no good""
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book
Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya, it hit ya like flu
Better times will pick ya, do what you gotta do
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light saying

Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better

(I heard my people saying)
Pain will make it better

No wetter, four-letter, mo' better
Slow pain, no gain, go getta
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather but well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that gain makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation
But not for me G, I’m into public relations
That's food for your, De La Soul, word to the letter

Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I heard my nana say it say)

The bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus, talking Watts to Mobile
Now we're on a house on a hill
Struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT coudn't cover the bills
When life came with a couple of spills
But we're gonna use that pain fo' fuel so

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better

Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution

That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke

Oh, and escape this mind control

Are you sure it's God you serving?
Obligated to a system

I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow

Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here

'Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world

Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0

As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe (check it out)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two

I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker
Hah, come on, what you say?

I don't wanna live no more

And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong

We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold that's all

I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play

Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'

Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages

It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest

How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are
Just admit it 'fore you get admitted

Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper

Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a (Doctor's) assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—

I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together
Sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my mama made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me

And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story
Mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me
Made just for me",1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0

I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance

It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

You could never kill my high

I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbors' fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

531,Pink Floyd,Rock,Dogs,Shine On,1977.0,"You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer


And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

(Stone, stone, stone...)

Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man

Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life?
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

""Don't cross him, don't boss him
""He's wild in his sorrow
""He's riding and hiding his pain
""Don't fight him, don't spite him
""Just wait 'til tomorrow

The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands

And all other things won't be the same

Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay""

So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit

Take a toke, but don't choke

Never let me slip, ‘cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'

The birds hush their singing

Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man

I'm in the vicinity of a nigga that can spit it with me
Feel the fire whenever we act up
Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery
So forget about it when you hear about it
Cause it's too fast when I pass the baton to Busta
Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm
Every murder is a structure
Every time I hit you niggers with another jam be blacking
I be sounding like a nigga full of anger
Now I'm back to beat you in the head, I'll bring another banger
With my nigga Twist, everything we do be up to wanger
You don't really, really wanna see the way that I come
And I'll give it to you, get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb
Do it how I wanna do it 'till I make another nigga drop
I put my money on it, homie, I'm the one
Go on here, pick it up, carry it the way you wanna carry it
Do whatever you wanna do
Show the competition how we gunning too when we coming through
Better never let a nigga never get in front of you

If I'm running outta breath, he gonna pick up where I left off
Keep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness
I'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off
Go faster than Ricky Bobby, kill him in Talladega Nights
Niggas try to get up, when a nigga hit up
When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price
Look, why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste
Of the shit I got, let me put it all up in your face
When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place
Everybody better listen here
Cause you know when I bring him I will never, never stop
Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top
Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block
Everybody better stand clear
Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up
Motivated for murder whenever I act up
A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up
Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up
Killing everybody when I bust a clip off
Cause I'mma be attacking them with the insane flow
Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps
And my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt
Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts
Now I'm sailing on the beat the way I'm sailing on the boat
The way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow
You don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya

You can talk about it with a bunch of people
That say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythem
Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang ‘em
And get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em
When I do it its gotta be accurate
Like I'm attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking I’m back and infant
Cause every time we in the place you feeling the capacity
I be coming with it, he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid I gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it
Don’t you ever forget it the way we coming
And they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic
So give us the credit and I thought that we should oughta
Be coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it

We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

See, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now
And yes, we used to live on the strip
Even though a nigga higher level trappin' now
Superceded every one of my little struggles and
Failure has never ever been an option (trust)

And I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!

When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected
It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed
At the worst they probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line
Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
Sing it, yeah!

Shit that I can leave for my children's children's children's children
Now on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come
Fightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it

Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Why'd you have to go?

This is just a dream

Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door

And one must chose which side they join

Yeah
And meanwhile one man's meal
Is another man's poison
Mankind will do what they must to survive
Innit
Hear me now

In a gunman world
Any night him clock in at work
Marrow splatter, the toolbox pull
The magazine inna the two Glock full
And he's watching as the days go by
And he's counting as his peers all die
Sleeping with the rifle 'cross his chest
So he never gets a good night's rest
And then he's cranky in the morning times
And more victims have to lose their lives
The community a twist and twirl
Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world
In a gunman life
He might not come home from work one night
So every minute matter
Ignores advice
From his weeping baby mother and child
That he won't win every game he plays
So she know he'll meet his end one day
Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe
And have to take another gunman's life
What if a backstabber names his price
And how ironic if him dead from knife
The 'mount of bullet weh him put 'pon boy
Job description: kill and destroy

Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?

Is it worth it?

Life is so stressful
Back to school time come
'cuz when a gunman work
If he is successful
And the job is well done
Then there will be an unsolved crime
With no one to fill out all blank line
John Public haffi hear and deaf
Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff
Does he get nervous just like you and I?
Watching out if the police pass by
'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail
Then it's either dead house or jail
What will it cost to make a gunman rich?
How many lives before a gunman switch?
The truth me want the youth them stop ignore
Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh

Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next one fall
Tell me is it worth it all?

Tell me is it worth it all?

Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

And when a gunman makes choice
I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind
And does a gunman think twice?
Before him takes another someone's life?
I wonder what it is a gunman say
To the Father when a gunman pray
Does he kiss his kids to bed at night?
Making sure the blanket tucked just right?
Nothing no scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no
Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no

The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you

For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled

With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you

Across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all
She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cuz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

In a world filled with magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world


Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Transmitting like you're made of man

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy

Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""

I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea

It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em ""bounce!""
Number 6: that goddamn credit? forget it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10: a strong word called ""consignment""
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""
Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up

Well every ho have it's stick in a bush
What happen to me...she must be somewhere out there
Now where could she be?
Caught up passionately in a love rhapsody
I'm like waiting on some honey
But there ain't no queen bee
Everybody's laughing
Some say I'm silly
No infatuation, no love fantasy
Woman you lead my life on a string
I can't tell the on and off thing
I'm oh so lonely inside so I sing

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
This is my chat (cho)

I would spend my nights at home
But if it means contention
I'd rather be alone
Tell the service man cut the phones
Lock all communication
If there's no light within my day
I'd rather stay in isolation
For that special someone a lifetime I'll wait
I know that I'll be okay
Cross my heart, every day I live I pray
And I know she'll come my way
Night and day for this woman I pray

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached

The pin stripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside? I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at their man eye, big man, they never try

Plus I'm fucking, bitches ain't my homegirls now

Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés pass off a global

Getting larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no telling where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space

To protect my position, my corner, my lair

Her eyes sparkling
Just her voice and what
She said let my poor head spin
Raggamuffin Shaggy
With a musical swing
I say
Pretty little woman
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say
Pretty little woman
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee

In the summertime
When the weather is high
You can stretch right up
And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women
On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride
And see now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Though the speed limit's twenty five
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
I said pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as honey
Sting like bumble bee
It's a summertime affair
In the atmosphere
I man love off her attire
And the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tyre
And a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up
Not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my
Christas so the girl them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon
As your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career
So tell the world beware
Cause it's a brand new
Selection for your musical ear

The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the la, smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hellbound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultraviolet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop your breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws 'cause tonight — ""It's yours!""

Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp

You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands, bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit, explicit
I crystallize the rhyme so you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4

Evergreen smoking estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the ""W"" and ""Spiegel"" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole juks

Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Late in the hot joints taking the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.""
When I was arrested I was dressed in black,
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Got up next morning about a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court""
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, in the first degree
I hollered, ""Lawdy, Lawdy, have mercy on me""

But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio
And it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say

Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs
Tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s

Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free

But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back

Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Saturday, it's a Saturday
It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the weekend check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Five days you work
One whole day to play
Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
(Is the word, is the word, is the word)

Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a bounce, rock, skate, roll fest to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
Cause all we need is feet

But promote the hustle cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in

(Is there a Dred on skates?)
Yes, man
(So kick the wham on this jam)
Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, huh
It's a Saturday

A message to God

Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen

If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this.""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.""

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy

And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark

And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long

845,De La Soul,Hip-Hop,The Magic Number,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Three, that’s the Magic Number
Yes, it is, it’s the magic number
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community
Was born three: Mase, Dove and me
And that’s the magic number
(What does it all mean?)

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos’ pleasure
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in my measure
Measure in my music, raised in three parts
Casually see but don’t do like the Soul
Cause seein’ and doin’ are actions for monkeys
Doin’ hip hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name’s Brewster, cause Brewster's a Punk (three)
Parents let go cause there’s magic in the air
Criticising rap shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires
And don’t get offended while Mase do-si-do’s your daughter
A tri-camera rolls since our music’s now set
Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y. production
It stands for “Da Inner Sound, Y’all” and y’all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function

Everybody wants to be a deejay
Everybody wants to be an emcee
But being speakers are the best
And you don’t have to guess
De La Soul posse consists of three
And that’s the magic number

This here piece of the pie
Is not dessert, but the course that we dine
And three out of every darn time
The effect is “Mmmm” when a daisy grows in your mind
Showing true position, this here piece is
Kissin’ the part of the pie that's missin’
When that negative number fills up the cavity
Maybe you can subtract it
You can call it your lucky partner
Maybe you can call it your adjective
But odd as it may be
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be
My three: Mase, Pos and me
And that’s the Magic Number
Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who honor the scroll
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Set aside a legal substance to feed ‘em
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug
Time is a factor so it's time that counts
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number
Now you may try to subtract it
But it just won't go away
Three times one?
(What is it?)
(One, two, three!)
And that's a Magic Number

I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation

I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
I remember your face, I remember your way

How could I forget?
A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallel amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of departure
Gave in your pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you
Cause I kept wanting to feature
With them other females on they songs too
Your words spoken in mono for monogamy
Telling me I had to go cause I chose
Stereo for stereotypical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps
For you to fall in for me again
Who hates you to tell me
""Slow up the pace, maybe erase, don't…""

Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...

Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance just showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
""Forgivin' won't erase the bitter past""
But I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit, you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

I remember you now (Accountability is major)
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
Cause time can't be replaced
And I don't want to stay

Cause, oh, it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's so dah-dah-dee-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
It's so easy to fall
In dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
Remember your way

It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine

Told me to kneel down and pray

I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart

""Lauryn, baby use your head""

Than to wait at Zion's door

The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be

Is only one God could create

Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

The way they act

Uh-huh

The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

Okay

The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

Yeah

It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

That's deep

That's what I'm talking about

There at a table, dealing stud

Now you're going to die!!""

But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss

Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever

Cold and uninviting, partially naked

Headlines of death and sorrow - they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage

Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows - gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting

I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery
You know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""

It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses

As I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus Saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British Rail poster read ""Have an Awayday - a cheap holiday - Do it today!""

And thought about my wife
Cause they took the keys - and she'll think it's me

He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man, you ought to see her fly

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt

Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean

But little did he know that
Eventually the enemy
Will stand aside and look
While we slash and kill
Our own brothers
Knowing that already
They are the victims of the situation
Still licking wounds from brutality
Still licking wounds from humiliation
She said all these words and the
Wrinkles on her face became
Perfect trails for the tears and she said;
Chorus: (x3)
We are the victims everytime
We got double trouble everytime
She took me outside to the churchyard
Showed me graves on the ground
And she said;
There lies a man who fought for equality
There lies a boy who died in his struggle
Can all these heroes die in vain

Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity

I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show

Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go

Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly

Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
""Why'd you do it?""

The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister doesn't miss when she aims her gun

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one I'm standing on

I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along

I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly

Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune

Became the special man

Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego

I hits 'em up for the circle, that's how I'm livin'
Crowbars in the house and gat is on a mission
You can be Blood, or you can see Crippin' fool
But I ain't trippin'
My homie Snoop kicks the gin and juice and that's alright
But a-Coolio with the flow seems to yak all night

Rollin' with my homies (sippin' we yak all night, yeah)
Sippin' on yak all night (I got us on the way in the CPT, and it's alright)

Pumpin' up the keg and roll it in a paper
It's like a match, you light it up and pass it to your neighbour
Night time is the right time... a-DYNAMITE!!
We're gonna have a good time
I jump back in the wagon, lock up the ass
Pop in the tape and a match
West when I fly I take the exit on Crenshaw
And guess what I saw
Two fools at the light, they stared me up
But I just look 'em in the eye and I say, ""Wassup?""
And even though I really don't want no trouble
I got thirty-one replies to bust your bubble
I don't really wanna hurt nobody
So I keeps on rollin' on my way to the party
I just wanna kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Pass me the cup so we can get twisted


I'm rollin with my homies, yeah...
'Said we'd yak all night, yeah yeah...
I roll up to the party and I'm straight old bent
And 'catchin' me a freak was my intent
There's a whole pack o' rats' ass standin' in the front
So I drops the ass and let the sistas bump
Here comes one now, she's on the tip
She says she likes the way my woofers kick
But I don't fall in love with every girl I see
So I pass up two and go straight to three
She got a ass like the back of a bus, cuz
And that's why I say ""In Crips We Trust""
I let her hit my twenty, got straight to the point
Wassup? Do you wanna kick it or what?
I ain't got time to be frontin', I ain't talkin' 'bout nuttin' Just a little sumpin' sumpin'
If you're fine and you won't front

You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, ""Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like, ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin..

When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared..
The rose that grew from concrete

Did you hear..
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned to walk without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete

Keepin all these dreams

It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun

What's the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit
Can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you
And that's just being real with you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they
(Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth
And we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left

I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back
(Right) Just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one,
Nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed:
""Whose throat is it?""
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up

That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

All day long in the field hauling corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard everyday
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, to complain there was no need
She's smiled in mommy's understanding way
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog, money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired

It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
How does it feel when you've got no herb?
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
If you got no herb you will walk an' talk
So I lef' my gate and went out for a walk
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I hear them say
How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side
It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know
So I stopped to find out what was going on
How do you find when you make your stuff
For the spirit of Jah, you know he leads me on
Them all have a leaf at the dreadlocks' camp
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing
I could feel the chill as I see and heard them say

Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same

I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust

It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on

Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And now she's wonderin who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar like born to be wild
But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar
A waste of a sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Work the cold nights red district places

More male customers than Old Navy
She love limelight more than John Swayze
Seen more miles than a rental, Avis

Because she got a insatiable appetite
For stayin out late night with all the parasites
Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like
Five minutes, she stay on the move
She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself
I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
And now she on the track workin while she wastin away
It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay

Ego need feedin now no one's mercy
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin
Behind the curtain she's really hurtin
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer that bring and cook the rock down
And she without sinnin will spot the first stone

My whole life flashed before my eyes, man

Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause I'm down for my set
I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits
I don’t give a shit

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning taking out the trash
Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the peddles, the other on the handle bars
Tryna be ghetto stars
They said, ""are you from the Westside is it so?""
I said, ""hell yeah and who want to know?""

Puddle full of blood
Left for dead, the pain starts to spread

I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
Now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don’t work it don’t even hurt

A'be pissing through a tube

Now I'm drinking Ripple

To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired
They mad cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
Depending on that to keep my ass alive
I don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fucking legs looking like tooth picks
Some times I can’t deal
Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch
Now I'm on the torch
Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldn’t make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2-year-old
You can’t get a sip from the brew I hold
It’s the only friend to a stranger

But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
""was it def?""
And with the straighest face I be like, ""hell yes.""

But edition up here by the miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny, jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me, Myself, and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like, ""oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone she'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak.""
So no problemo, just play the demo and at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind cause I'll just lay it down the line

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
POS:
Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you.. peace

With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head and my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
""Why had I run?""
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find""
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:

But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets

And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again

You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya

It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

Let me continue my demonstration
For the congregation

Ya'll don't know about mary jane

Ya'll don't know about mary jane

As i walk around the edges of my mind
In an attempt to contemplate
What it really is that makes me tick
I'm reminded of emotions that saturate
My thoughts like sunshine
It always ain't the first time
That i'm feelin' this, feelin that
I'm feelin' that
They don't know about my baby
And the healing power
It makes a strong man stronger
And a crazy man sing

And makes me see things in a way

Mary ease pain
And mary never complains

Don't listen to what they say 'cause
Mary never contrary
Mary mary very
Nececessary extraordinary
Me and mary to the mortuary
Just one kiss on her sweet lips
And i become a visionary
Mary never the same
Mary don't change
Mary make a man walk a mile in the rain
Mary mary never temporary
She's my sanctuary
And when the love comes down
I'm the beneficiary
Some say if it's this good
Then it must be wrong
But mary makes me feel so good
'cause mary lasts so long
Mary mary got no secondary
Sweeter than a cherry
Blackberry, or a strawberry

I'm in love with with mary jane
I'm not the only one
Mary likes to play around
I let her have her fun
She's not the kind of girl
That you can just tie down
Mary likes to spread her love
And turn my head around
I'm in love with mary jane
She's my main thing
She makes me feel alright
Makes my heart sing
And when i'm feelin' low
It comes as no surprise
Turns me on with her love
Takes me to paradise

And things you ain't never thought about thinkin
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin and smokin
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin


You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side


As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big

My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?

Native New Yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter, stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Yeah, it feel good, don't it? Uhh
For shining Your light on me
It feel good, don't it? Uhh
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Ay, I want to let y'all know
Ay, ay, I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy
For shining Your light on me
And you listening to Q-Tip

Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making it though
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
Beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, ""Stop killing me, wolf""
Whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Oxy in me pulse, he don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit we sinners, when me and Abstract together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas, drink Alizé liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus, we're prone to handle
We're gentlemen

Not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me

You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'

As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, ""He won't do this again""

I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me

Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna

They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose

Cuts and dents, they catch the light

You tell that bitch what you feelin'

To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes

Walk up to the door and right before he knock

Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie

Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews

Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?

Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done

And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends

Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

And shed so many tears

So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light

Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even

How could you trust a ho? (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a ho's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now

I once had a bitch named Annie Mae
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucka, licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop we got news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit)
I un-cock my shit
I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit

I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
Cause I'm doin my own thing down with the swang
I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal, cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck, and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung, and with the nuts hung

Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

Party and bullshit
And party and bullshit

Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll, see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping
Ain't no stopping Big Poppa
I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the East Coast overdose
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

Party and bullshit
And party and bullshit

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
(Music stops
Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo, chill, man, chill!"")
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that...

So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

And the memories to black and white

Blowing across my life

Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block

Rising against that blue sky?

Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue

And look at yourself and what really matters?

Close your eyes and not go to sleep?

Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family

Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes

Smell whiskey in the air

Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by

That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither

But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—See? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

1242,2Pac,Hip-Hop,Dear Mama,Me Against the World,1995.0,"You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

1256,Carrie Underwood,Country,Heartbeat,Storyteller,2015.0,"I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

Sucker MCs should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect
They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a verbal treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?
Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send
Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can jaw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these

There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong

Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

Back to the day I was born on
They slapped me into line as it crossed my mind
I've felt better
I've felt worse
This is my life and it's all very well
But never never never again, oh
As they say ""We've been robbed""
And don't you know that this time
Love, just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that
Distance myself from the things I'd like but
Everyone has something I need
Don't let me wake up & find
All those others leaving me behind
If you don't have a clue about life
Then I'm happy to say
Neither have I although
I'm not going to shrug my shoulders & suck my thumb
This time
Cos there's something I deserve
Love, just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that
Picture my house in a postcard town
Picture a bomb in the sky
History at your door
Who could ask for more?
I've felt better
So kill me with love
Just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that

With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth
But I hear no sound

I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

I can turn
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing


I feel the steel butt jump
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself

But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'

Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she’s gonna teach everything you’ll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners to love and laugh and dream
And she’ll put you on the path that’ll bring you back to me

The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get


And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I
Got more to say
And the older I get
The more thankful I feel
